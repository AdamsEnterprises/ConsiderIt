</div>
<p>
      <b>The Law as it Presently Exists</b><br> The
      legislature has enacted various laws that direct where and how tolls
      can be set for bridges, ferries, tunnels, roads, and related
      facilities. Those laws also restrict the ways in which toll revenue
      can be used. Initiative Measure No. 1125 would impose additional
      restrictions on the use of toll revenue.<br> &nbsp;<br> The
      Eighteenth Amendment to the Washington Constitution requires that
      certain state revenue be used only for &ldquo;highway
      purposes.&rdquo; That amendment, which was approved in 1944,
      provides that the following revenue must be paid into the state
      treasury and placed in a special fund to be used exclusively for
      &ldquo;highway purposes&rdquo;: all fees the state collects as
      license fees for motor vehicles; all excise taxes the state collects
      on the sale, distribution, or use of motor vehicle fuel; and all
      other state revenue &ldquo;intended to be used for highway
      purposes.&rdquo; That fund is the &ldquo;motor vehicle fund&rdquo;

      established in RCW 46.68.070. The Eighteenth Amendment also lists
      some uses that must be considered &ldquo;highway purposes,&rdquo;
      including the necessary operating, engineering, and legal expenses
      connected with the administration of public highways, county roads,
      and city streets; and the construction, reconstruction, maintenance,
      repair, and betterment of public highways, county roads, bridges,
      and city streets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since well before the adoption of
      the Eighteenth Amendment, the legislature has authorized the use of
      tolls as one means of paying for the acquisition, construction, and
      operation of bridges, ferries, tunnels, roads, and related
      facilities. That authority includes the use of tolls to retire bonds
      issued to finance acquisition and construction of bridges, ferries,
      tunnels, roads, and related facilities; tolls used for that purpose
      must be deposited in special trust funds kept separate from all
      other funds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under current law, the legislature must
      authorize the collection of tolls but it can delegate the authority
      to set the amounts of tolls. The legislature has designated the
      state Transportation Commission as the &ldquo;tolling
      authority&rdquo; responsible for setting most tolls, under standards
      and guidelines established in law to ensure that the revenue
      generated by tolls is sufficient to pay maintenance and operating
      costs for the facility; pay principal and interest on bonds, related
      financing costs, and insurance; and reimburse the motor vehicle fund
      for any money used from that fund to pay for bonds.&nbsp; Unless
      otherwise provided in law, all revenue from a toll facility is to be
      used for that facility, and tolls may continue to be collected after
      initial construction has been paid for to fund additional capacity,
      maintenance, and operation of the facility.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The
      Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</b><br> Initiative
      Measure No. 1125 would require that toll amounts be set by the
      legislature by majority vote, rather than by the Transportation
      Commission, and would make the setting of toll amounts subject to
      statutes that require preparation of various reports and analyses
      relating to costs. It would require that tolls be &ldquo;uniform and
      consistent&rdquo; and would not allow variable pricing of
      tolls. (&ldquo;Variable priced&rdquo; tolls typically are higher
      during periods of traffic congestion and lower at other times of the
      day or week.)<br> &nbsp;<br> While the measure would leave in place
      the authority to collect and use tolls for the preservation,
      maintenance, management, and operation of a facility, it would add
      provisions that limit the use of some tolls to construction and
      capital improvement only and that require tolls on future facilities
      to end after the cost of the project is paid. The measure would
      require revenue from tolls to be used only for purposes
      &ldquo;consistent with&rdquo; the Eighteenth Amendment, and would
      prohibit any revenue in the motor vehicle fund or any toll fund from
      being transferred to the &ldquo;general fund or other funds&rdquo;

      and used for &ldquo;non-transportation purposes.&rdquo;<br>
      &nbsp;<br> The measure would restate the existing requirement that
      tolls must be used on the facility for which they are collected,
      explicitly referencing the Interstate 90 floating bridge. The
      measure also would prohibit the state or a state agency from
      transferring or using &ldquo;gas-tax-funded or toll-funded lanes on
      state highways&rdquo; for &ldquo;non-highway purposes.&rdquo; <p>
